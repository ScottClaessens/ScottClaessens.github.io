I'm a researcher in the behavioural sciences with a passion for research methods, data science, and statistics.

I received my PhD from the University of Auckland in 2022. I now work as a Research Associate in Psychology at the University of Kent. My work has been published in top academic journals, including Nature Communications, Nature Human Behaviour, PNAS, Proceedings of the Royal Society B, and Scientific Reports.
