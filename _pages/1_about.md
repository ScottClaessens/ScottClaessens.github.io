I'm a researcher in the evolutionary and behavioural sciences with a passion for research methods, data science, and statistics. Broadly, my research interests are cultural evolution, cooperation, political ideology, and animal cognition.

I received my PhD from the University of Auckland in 2022. Since then, I have been working as a postdoctoral Research Fellow in the School of Psychology. My work has been published in top academic journals, including Nature Communications, Nature Human Behaviour, PNAS, and Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Over the years, I have developed an expertise in Bayesian statistics and causal inference methods, which I apply regularly in my work. I am also fluent in the R programming language, which I use to ensure that my research is fully reproducible.
