Beyond my interests in the evolution of cooperation and political ideology, I am also interested in the evolution of behaviour and cognition more generally. I have collaborated on both empirical and theoretical work in this area.

Alongside colleagues at the University of Auckland, I have contributed to empirical research in comparative cognition, a field that studies the evolutionary origins of cognition across non-human animal species. 

In one of our comparative cognition projects, we studied the ultimate function of contagious yawning in dogs (see paper [here](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2019.2236){:target="_blank"}). Contagious yawning is an interesting behaviour to study because it has been used as an indicator of empathy in non-human animals. In our experiment and re-analysis of previous studies, we found that dogs do indeed yawn contagiously, but we did not find evidence for particular biases in yawning (e.g. familiarity bias) that would be expected if yawning were an indicator of empathy. Dogs might have evolved empathic cognitive mechanisms, but if they have, contagious yawning is likely not a good indicator for them.

In another project, we have been studying how widespread tool use is across parrot species. Tool use is another interesting behaviour to study because it requires sophisticated cognitive abilities. By studying the phylogenetic distribution of tool use across parrot species, we can infer its sequence of evolution.

I have also contributed to theoretical work on human social evolution. In collaboration with colleagues at Arizona State University, we developed an agent-based model to explain the evolution of concealed ovulation in humans (see paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-01038-9){:target="_blank"}). Unlike in other primates whose ovulation is revealed physiologically (e.g. sexual swellings in baboons), human ovulation is relatively concealed. But why? We put forward the hypothesis that concealed ovulation in females functioned to avoid competition between rival females for mates. In an agent-based model of an ancestral mating environment, we showed that concealed ovulation is adaptive under conditions of costly female competition.
