Evidence from political psychology suggests that political attitudes vary along two dimensions: Right-Wing Authoritarianism (i.e. group conformity vs. individual autonomy) and Social Dominance Orientation (i.e. social dominance vs. cooperation). Similarly, evidence from social psychology suggests that cooperative behaviour also varies along two dimensions: Norm-Enforcing Punishment (i.e. a willingness to punish wrongdoers) and Cooperativeness (i.e. a willingness to pay costs to benefit others). These parallel findings suggest that both political ideology and general social behaviour may share a common underlying mechanism.

This will be the topic of my PhD in Psychology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Along with my supervisor [Quentin Atkinson](http://www.fos.auckland.ac.nz/~quentinatkinson/Quentin_Atkinsons_Website/Home.html){:target="_blank"}, we will study cooperative behaviour across a range of well-established economic games, and correlate these results with longitudinal data on political ideology from [The New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS)](https://www.psych.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-research/research-groups/new-zealand-attitudes-and-values-study.html){:target="_blank"}.
