Political ideology varies substantially between people. While traditionally such variation has been assumed to be socially-acquired, emerging evidence in behavioural genetics suggests that political ideology is largely heritable. This opens the door to such questions as: why are we political at all? Has evolution played a role in the differences we see across party lines? Is man "by nature a political animal", as Aristotle once claimed?

The cognitive, cultural, and evolutionary foundations of political ideology will be the topic of my PhD in Psychology at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Along with my supervisor [Quentin Atkinson](http://www.fos.auckland.ac.nz/~quentinatkinson/Quentin_Atkinsons_Website/Home.html){:target="_blank"}, we will study how people with different fundamental political ideologies behave in social dilemmas.
